3,Intel?is?finding?big?value?in?big?data
4,Over?the?past?two?years?the?company?has?developed?more?than?a?dozen?data?intensive?projects?that?have?bolstered?both?its?operational?efficiency?and?bottom?line
5,According?to?Ron?Kasabian?general?manager?of?big?data?solutions?for?Intel?data?center?group?these?ongoing?efforts?have?resulted?in?millions?of?dollars?of?cost?savings
6,We?started?the?year?before?last?realizing?we?had?an?opportunity?to?leverage?data?that?is?floating?around?the?enterprise?today?data?we?were?not?dealing?with?Kasabian?told?InformationWeek?in?a?phone?interview
7,Intel?big?data?initiatives?are?summarized?in?the?company?2012?13?IT?annual?report?which?discusses?the?efforts?of?chipmaker??in?other?areas?such?as?cloud?computing
8,Big?data?and?predictive?analytics?are?helping?Intel?bring?new?chips?to?market?faster?said?Kasabian
9,We?run?a?huge?number?of?complicated?tests?on?every?single?chip?that?comes?through?the?manufacturing?process?he?said?And?as?we?are?ramping?up?new?chips?we?uncover?lots?of?bugs?and?fix?them
10,Every?chip?Intel?makes?goes?through?a?quality?check?which?includes?an?extensive?series?of?tests?By?analyzing?historical?data?collected?during?manufacturing?Intel?can?reduce?the?number?of?tests?it?conducts
11,We?are?taking?some?of?the?information?that?is?coming?out?of?the?manufacturing?process?for?those?pre?release?chips?and?looking?at?it?at?the?wafer?level?said?Kasabian
12,Instead?of?running?every?single?chip?through?19000?tests?we?can?focus?tests?on?specific?chips?to?cut?down?test?time
13,This?predictive?analytics?process?implemented?on?a?single?line?of?Intel?Core?processors?in?2012?allowed?Intel?to?save?$3?million?in?manufacturing?costs
14,In?2013?14?Intel?expects?to?extend?the?process?to?more?chip?lines?and?save?an?additional?$30?million?the?company?said
15,Data?intensive?processes?also?help?Intel?detect?failures?in?its?manufacturing?line?which?is?a?highly?automated?environment
16,A?lot?of?what?we?are?doing?is?pulling?log?files?out?of?manufacturing?and?test?machines?said?Kasabian
17,Across?our?entire?factory?network?we?are?talking?about?5?terabytes?an?hour?So?it?is?very?big?volume
18,By?capturing?and?analyzing?this?information?Intel?can?determine?when?a?specific?step?in?one?of?its?manufacturing?processes?starts?to?deviate?from?normal?tolerances
19,Big?data?benefits?Intel?security?efforts?too?The?company?says?its?big?data?platform?can?process?200?billion?server?events?and?provide?early?warning?of?security?threats?within?30?minutes
20,Using?an?early?version?of?Intel?Hadoop?distribution?the?company?set?up?this?security?platform?in?mid?2012
21,Across?the?entire?network?there?are?these?devices?called?NIDs?or?network?intrusion?devices?said?Kasabian
22,They?are?little?devices?that?check?packets?flying?across?the?network
23,We?are?pulling?all?this?data?across?thousands?of?these?devices?and?feeding?it?into?Hadoop
24,After?using?Hadoop?to?capture?and?classify?the?data?Intel?extracts?the?relevant?information?and?loads?it?into?an?MPP?massive?parallel?processing?database
25,We?are?looking?for?anomalies?said?Kasabian
26,We?started?last?summer?with?server?anomalies?on?a?small?number?of?servers?
27,By?the?end?of?the?summer?we?were?examining?pretty?much?all?the?servers?on?the?Intel?network
28,Based?on?its?experiences?thus?far?Intel?believes?in?big?data?long?term?potential
29,We?started?with?three?or?four?projects?in?2011?said?Kasabian
30,In?2012?we?had?between?12?and?14?projects?that?together?represented?well?over?$100?million?dollars?in?value?to?Intel?either?in?cost?savings?or?cost?avoidance
31,He?added:?We?are?just?beginning?to?scratch?the?surface
